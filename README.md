### Q1 Room Reservation System Database Schema

#### Overview
This schema is designed to support a global hotel chain's operations, focusing on room reservations, customer management, and payment processing. The structure ensures scalability and maintainability, essential for handling multiple hotels across various locations.

(Scalability and Maintainability
This schema is designed to be both scalable and maintainable)

###### Scalability: 
Allows handling an increasing amount of data as the hotel chain grows. Each table is designed to facilitate the addition of new records without affecting the performance of queries significantly.
###### Maintainability: 
Changes to the database (such as adding new features or room types) can be managed with minimal modifications to the existing structure.

#### Use Cases
###### Reservation Management: 
Efficiently create, update, and manage reservations.
###### Customer Relationship Management: 
Track customer data and their reservation history.
###### Financial Transactions: 
Handle payments linked to reservations, including multi-currency support for global operations.




### Q2 Creating a CSV

#### Overview
This project involves using data from several provided CSV files to generate a consolidated CSV file. The resulting file is structured to support a housing management system, linking students to their housing assignments and academic majors.

#### Files
- inventory_data.csv - Contains information about the housing inventory including building, room, and bed identifiers.
- majors_data.csv - Lists academic majors with unique identifiers and descriptions.
- occupancy_data.csv - Maps students to their respective rooms and beds.
- persons_data.csv - Personal information about students including names, email addresses, and majors.
- generate_csv.sql - SQL queries used to merge and transform data from the above files into the required format.
- output.csv - The final CSV file generated by the SQL scripts, containing the structured student housing assignments.

#### CSV Output Format
The final CSV includes the following headers, each with specified data types and conditions:

#### Data Cleaning Policies
- Email Uniqueness: Each email is verified to ensure it is unique within the dataset.
- Major ID Resolution: Majors listed by name in the persons_data are matched against majors_data to retrieve corresponding IDs.
- Address Parsing: Addresses are parsed into multiple components where available. Only complete addresses are saved in address1.
- Date Standardization: All dates of birth are formatted to the standard YYYY-MM-DD format.

#### Instructions for Running the Script
- Ensure all CSV files are placed in the designated input directory.
- Run finalcsvQ2.sql in your SQL environment.
- Check finalcsvQ2.csv for the final output and errors.log for any processing errors.


## Instructions for Running the Project
- Clone the repositoty onto you local computer(Azure Data Studio or any other tool that works best).
- Q1 project in the Housingcloud folder is basically the generation of different tables that are required for the Room Reservation and there is also a stored procedure for room booking that I have included.
- Q2 project in the Housingcloud folder is required for the generation of the csv file that was asked for.
